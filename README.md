Erie County Courts – Website Redesign Demo

Role: Frontend Developer & UX DesignerTech: HTML, CSS, Formspree, GitHub Pages

 What I Built:

This is a responsive mock redesign of a county court website, designed to be accessible, user-friendly, and informative. It includes realistic sections such as Court Schedules, Online Services, and a Contact form. The form is fully functional and integrates with Formspree to handle public inquiries via email.

 Key Features:

Functional navigation tabs linking to each section

A working contact form connected to Formspree for real email handling

Accessibility features including keyboard navigation and ARIA labels

A mock analytics dashboard displaying sample traffic metrics

Clean, responsive layout suitable for desktop and mobile

Why I Built It:

I wanted to demonstrate how I would approach a public-facing government site from both a technical and user-experience standpoint. This project shows I can not only code the front end but also integrate tools that make a site actually useful for real users.

This demo reflects the responsibilities of a Website Coordinator role and includes hands-on implementation of usability, communication, accessibility, and trustworthiness — all crucial for any public sector digital presence.
